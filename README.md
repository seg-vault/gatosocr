# Gato's OCR Web App

An app to make searchable PDF documents

## Attribution

Significant use of Spring boot documentation example code was used to create the file upload functionality.
Their code is licenced under ASLv2 so I wanted to give the same license to this project. 

tess4j is used to perform the OCR/PDF creation.
