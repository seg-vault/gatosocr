# OCR Web App

An app to make PDF documents searchable

## Attribution

Significant use of Spring boot documentation example code was used to create the file upload functionality.
Their code is licenced under ASLv2 so I wanted to give the same license to this project. 

Big thank you to [dyllanwli](https://gist.github.com/dyllanwli) and their [gist](https://gist.github.com/dyllanwli/58fe0db862c823ebfc2fde1f8678d14c) on converting PDF to multi page tiff

tess4j is used to perform the OCR/PDF creation.
